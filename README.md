# GameLab

A Monorepo of Games made in C++. I'm using this to learn game development and C++. I'm using a monorepo so I can iterate when I move onto the next game and showcase my development.

The Games and Tools are numbered so that I can keep track of growth, 1 being the first game/tool made and whatever is highest is the latest project, e.g. \(Game/Tool\)-X-\(Name\) where X is the order of creation.

### Engine
This is the main piece of work to learn game engine development. I'm coding it all up, and each game/tool will use and possibly add to this project, fleshing it out until I make a full game/tool using this engine.
-  [Engine](Engine)

### Games:
Games made using the engine
-  [Game-1-CoinCollector](Games/Game_1_CoinCollector), a simple coin collector game around maps
-  [Game-2-CoinCollector_Refactor](Games/Game-2-CoinCollector_Refactor), a simple coin collector game around maps
-  [Game-3-Tiler](Games/Game-3-Tiler/), a simple coin collector game around maps

### Tools:
A collection of apps using
-  [SDL2_IMGUI_impl](Tools/SDL2_IMGUI_impl/), a demo of how SDL and ImGui work together for my reference.

### Scripts:
-  [scripts](Scripts), scripts for maintenance and management.
