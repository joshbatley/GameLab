# Game1

Simple game where a character moves around, and we can change the map with basic collision

### Retro

So it's all done some hacky code some dodgy pointers but the first thing that
resembles a game is done, you can move around it block you from going into walls
and you can change levels, think I'll do some minor refactoring and push it up
all the dodgy stuff will be there but you can move around.
