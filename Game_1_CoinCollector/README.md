So it's all done some hacky code some dodgy pointers but the first thing that
resembles a game is done, you can move around it block you from going into walls
and you can change levels, think I'll do some minor refactoring and push it up
all the dodgy stuff will be there but you can move around.

Take home points need to create a input manager and window manager think these
are some low hanging fruit i can do will create them and remake this code with those
libraries and see how much cleaner it is before moving onto the next game.
